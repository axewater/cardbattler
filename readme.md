# AceBattler: Card Battler
Version 0.1

## Overview

AceBattler is a single-player card battling game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a strategic gameplay loop where players draw cards, play creatures and spells, and engage in combat to reduce the opponent's hero health to zero. This version represents a refactored and improved implementation of the original card battler concept.

## Game Overview

In AceBattler, players take turns drawing cards from their deck and playing them onto the board. Creature cards can attack the opponent's creatures or hero, while spell cards can have various effects, such as dealing damage, healing, or buffing creatures.
